Tests about react projects on js and how to work with them

- [x] For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button  

- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.  

- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.  

- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).  

- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
